how to turn the above into reasonable output?  For example, "will it be windy
this week?"  A nice response would answer if it was going to be windier than
normal this week.  A shortcut might be to give some basic stats about it:

  the wind is predicted to be between 2 and 13 mph this week.
  for most of the week it will be under 6 mph, but in the middle of the week
    it might be around 8-13 mph.

while we are only displaying graphical output, a graph of expected windiness
would also be good.

this raises another question which is how we should convert the range of values
  into a string summarizing them ...

------

How to selectively show the dew point, along with the rest of the forecast.

generating just the susinct answer is different than generating other relevant
information.  Ideally, the former problem is a subset of the later.

What is the dew point is a good example of this problem.  We should show the
dew point, but we probably want to show more than just the dew point.  Maybe
this weeks weather, or predicted future dew points, or a comparison to historic
...

One Idea:

x[a.is] = "the dew point in %location%"
=>
x[wunderground.dew_point] = _dew_point
x[simple_display.related][a.is] = "weather in %location%"

This could spawn the weather translation in the same translation, or maybe the
simple_display could catch the text and call it seperately.  This way, it could
be streamed to the user.  Are there any other benefits to doing it that way?

It does raise an interesting idea which is how axpress might deal with streaming
I guess one easy way is to compile the query and then stream results through 
it ... Not really the same.  I think something like above where part of a query 
is a callback of sorts.

!! This also seems to make optional or priority translations important.  Not 
all translations are going to have related information to display.

However, this requires not optional translations, but optional parts to a query
which is completely different:

x[a.is] = "the query from the search/spoken field"
x[simple_display.text] = _out
| x[simple_display.related][simple_display.text] = _related

better yet:

x[a.is] = "the query from the search/spoken field"
x[simple_display.text] = _out

x[a.is] = "the dew point in %location%"
=>
x[wunderground.dew_point] = dew_point
x[simple_display.direct] = dew_point
x[simple_display.related][a.is] = "weather in %location%"

x[sd.direct] = top
x[sd.related] = bottom
=>
x[sd.text] = string.add(top, bottom)

In this way, the way the translations are seperated from eachother create
conditionals or classes in a procedural language.  How does that inform the
UI for writing these translations?

!!! This winds up being a lot of code for what otherwise might be a pretty simple
python script.  Where is the advantage here?  Can that be more of the focus?

maybe I should try writing the straight python version of this module and see
what it looks like.

Also note that some syntax change could result in about half the lines and chars

Not directly related to relase, but some documentation about it might be 
good ... might inform of changes in style/code
