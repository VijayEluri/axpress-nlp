Core assumptions made and information about translations needed for the compiler
to operate correctly:
* all input varialbes will be substituted for a literal value
* translations can not add triples which aren't already in the output description
  * NOTE: you can have a triple which is all varialbes, but this slows down the
          compilation step

Ff an input variable is bound in the input and output of a translation, the 
variable might be changed between the input and output.

some input variables might be deemed optional. (no value)  only if all triples
which use those variables are also optional ... I think





What does the output of the compiler look like?
note: the output is going to be piped into code which evaluates it, so it 
	doesn't need to be human readable ... except I have to write that code too
	so it should be human readable

{
	'guaranteed' : [<step>],
	'possible' : [<step>]
}

step := {
	'translation' : <translation>,
	'triplelist' : <triplelist>,
	'input-bindings' : <bindings>,
	'output-bindings' : <bindings>,
	'guaranteed' : [<step>],
	'possible' : [<step>],
}

triplelist := [<triple>]

What is needed to execute a compiled path?

follow guaranteed paths first

for translation :
	translation(vars = translation['input-bindings']


































With the following multiquery, which varialbes need to be bound in the where 
clause so that the write clause can execute?

	where translate
		image[file.filename] = "/home/dwiel/pictures/stitt blanket/*.jpg"[glob.glob]
		thumb = image.thumbnail(image, 4, 4, image.antialias)
		thumb_image = thumb[pil.image]
	write sparql
		image[amos.thumb] = thumb
		thumb[pil.image] = thumb_image

My first instinct was that every variable bound in both the 'current' subquery
and some future subquery[s] needs to be bound in the first case so that its 
value can be passed onto the future ones.

In this case however, the varialbe image is used in both cases as a bnode or
placeholder.  Its actual literal value is never defined and doesn't need to be
defined ...

well maybe image would be defined if it an image already existed in the sparql
triplestore ... so maybe this query would be more appropriet?

	where translate
		filename = "/home/dwiel/pictures/stitt blanket/*.jpg"[glob.glob]
	read sparql or write sparql
		image[file.filename] = filename
	where translate
		thumb = image.thumbnail(image, 4, 4, image.antialias)
		thumb_image = thumb[pil.image]
	write sparql
		image[amos.thumb] = thumb
		thumb[pil.image] = thumb_image

so this maybe is alright, but what about:

	
	where translate
		image[file.filename] = "/home/dwiel/pictures/stitt blanket/*.jpg"[glob.glob]
		thumb = image.thumbnail(image, 4, 4, image.antialias)
		thumb_image = thumb[pil.image]
	write translate
		window3d[window3d.background] = thumb_image

or what would be preferable is:

	where translate
		image[file.filename] = "/home/dwiel/pictures/stitt blanket/*.jpg"[glob.glob]
		thumb = image.thumbnail(image, 4, 4, image.antialias)
	write translate
		window3d[window3d.background] = thumb

Q: how could this be possible ? ... ?
A: would need to compile the whole thing 'together' ...

what happens if its all smushed into one query and compiled?

	compiled = compile(query = """
		image[file.filename] = "/home/dwiel/pictures/stitt blanket/*.jpg"[glob.glob]
		thumb = image.thumbnail(image, 4, 4, image.antialias)
	""", final_test = """
		window3d[window3d.background] = thumb
	""")

what about a more complex situation?

	where translate
		image[file.filename] = "/home/dwiel/pictures/stitt blanket/*.jpg"[glob.glob]
		thumb = image.thumbnail(image, 4, 4, image.antialias)
	write sparql
		image[amos.thumb] = thumb
		thumb[pil.image] = thumb_image
	write translate
		window3d[window3d.background] = thumb

	OK the where is the query and the writes are combined to the final_tests

For now, I think a read, then write format is > 90% of the power

### take 3

instead of passing bindings between each sub-query and instead of smushing into one big query which doesnt even really make syntactic sense ...
pass the entire set of triples and bindings on to the next subquery.


time-out:

problem: in example above, translations might be necessary in order to convert
the thumb variable into it's pil.image value, which is technically what is 
needed:

	window3d[window3d.background] = image
	image[pil.image] = _pil_image

better example:




what about a query with interleived read and writes?
why would this be necessary?
* if a write produced output, otherwise, why put a read after it?
* if it was important that a read happened sequentially after the write.  And
	required data bound from previous subqueries
	? how does time work?  How can it be used ...
	* for now, could just have time be implemented in some plugin
		for example, write out a MIDI note along with when it should be played
		could just have a generic plugin:
			timed_action[timed_action.time] = time
			timed_action[timed_action.action] = action
			action[action.callable] = True
			# or
			action is action.callable
			# or
			action.callable(action)
		constantly polling for actions to execute
			which is what I am afraid of ... How fast can this be?  Every time a triple
			is writen to the database that this is watching, it must be checked to see
			if it matches any of the plugins triples and if so, then the rest of the 
			database must also be checked.
		not constantly polling per se, more constantly watching.  The system itself
			allows for these plugins to be activated when matching information is added
		This process could be sped up incredibly with a hash lookup from predicates
			which have a list of which plugins are watching each predicate and go from
			there.  Other ways to quickly hash-match the patterns could work.
		
		There should be an effort to reduce the number of stores so that information
			can reliably be found in one spot.  This means that any plugin watching
			essentially the entire computer could cause things to be significantly 
			slower ...
		although, really, as long as the predicates are kept useful and unique, it
			should scale nearly infitily ...
		Problems could arise if compiled queries didn't know what predicates they
			were going to write, but no, it would have to be that they wouldn't know
			what predicates they are writing, which can't happen.
		Problems would arise if a plugin for some reason wanted to be making new 
			predicates all of the time.  For example, music_artist.beatles but for
			every artist name.  This technically would be allowed, but would obviously
			be super slow and would add unecessary size to the plugin hash.  Although
			it should be farily easy to keep reasonable.
		Cool
	











general:

Q: what if [in an application] you want to have a set of bindings or variables which
is always available in memory because it is so common?
A: write to SPARQL RAM xyz
	this keeps it in RAM ... but then what about speed at which the data is 
	retrieved out of here.  It has to be matched against every time ...
	A: in the future, an APP might also be able to optimize itself based on how
		its internal structures are being accessed.  If you only ever acces some 
		variable or match pattern like it is a set, then that is how it can be 
		stored ... 
		Q: What are the logistics of this ... ?
		Q: Does this then also limit how other applications might inspect and adjust
			this data?
			Q: does *all* data used in an app (even internal seemingly useless data)
				need to be accessible from everyone in whatever way?
			A: that does kinda seem to be the point here ...  Otherwise, whats the 
				point
			A: well you could specify in an app which data is public and which is 
				private.  Might need to do that for security reasons anyway ...
		Q: What is an app?
		A: a unified set of actions which seemlessly work together.
			Q: is it not the goal here to turn the desktop into one app in a way?
		Q: What does the UI look like?
		A: FOR NOW:
			user interface is a text box which allows the typing of a query in the logic
			style language or conceivably, in the near future, in an english like language.
			no need to reimplement firefox ...
		Q: How is this information accessed?
