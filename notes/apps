    * use remember the milk as backend
  * better weather app (ok for now ...)
    * forecast
    * nicer looking
    * show what was asked for, but also other relevant information
      * ! dew point translation directly to a display format is a bit odd ...
        * it seems that it might be due to the fact that the dew point will
          be present from the weather lookup even if the weather lookup was only
          to lookup the current weather.  At that point in the search space
          all kinds of information is known, so some hints as to which
          information was asked for need to be leeked out to the display path
      * ! also, with the weather example, there are a bunch of paths that are
          very similar.  Like dew point, or barometeric pressure, etc.  How can
          those code paths be DRY?

    * on desktop, this app doesn't make a whole lot of sense
    * should be relatively easy, but makes more sense on phone ...
    * nicer looking - show countdown timer for short alarms
    * fine for now to leave most of the work on the server side
    * allow setting sounds from freesound
    * - wake me up every morning at 8 am
    * - set an alarm for 5
    * - set an alarm for 5 on the last friday of the month
    * - set an alarm for noon using a pig sound
    * select which device/method to use to set the alarm

    * get some more basic freebase translations built in
    * ! special cases?
        * for example, have a view for most objects, but special case some of them too
        * this would be a rule which says that if translation 1 matches, don't
          even test translation 2.
    * _ multiple results at once - rework the evaluator
        * first pass of this working.  Still might have problems in edge cases
