use this for something useful

simplify
  - finish cleaning/fixing Evaluator.evaluate_step_with_bindings_set
  - refactor SimpleSparql out -> Axpress or just ax ?
  - use ENV paths
  - use relative paths. can see every translation in local direcotry like
    python (*.ax)
  - temp data paths - .axpress
  - allow code with #!/usr/bin/axpress

  - heavy refactor : what are component steps, how to name things differently to that effect.  also less confused overloading of how to find bindings, matches, etc.  matching one intermediate form with another hsa slight differences ...

bugs/features:
  - read_translate bindings_set recompiles for each bindings - should only need to compile once
  - disallow input variable names like bnode1 to avoid confusion and errors

conceptual:
  - lots of confusion is inevitable to due overloading list as a list of possibilities as well as an actual list
    perhaps something like this:
        class Set(list) : pass
        class SetMaker() :
            def __getitem__(self, *args) :
                return Set(*args)
        S = SetMaker()
        print S[1,2,3]
  - make optional parts of a query and part of a translation work
