refactor SimpleSparql out -> Axpress or just Ax ?
figure out why image average color translation doesn't work when the 
  similar hardcoded case does.  What is the difference?
  - bummer, don't remember the context here ...
figure out how to use axpress for something useful
  make it more robust (still frequently finding bugs ...)
figure out bug in pw code
! anything that can help with debugging?
figure out how to make library system more programming language like
  use paths?
  - maybe also relative paths? can see every translation in local direcotry
    under *.ax
figure out how to allow code with #!/usr/bin/axpress
figure out how to refactor into more simple/easier to debug/fewer bugs code
       might be helpful to write out all of the steps again; the new string
       matching code
read_translate bindings_set recompiles for each bindings - should only need to compile once
lots of confusion is inevitable to due overloading list as a list of possibilities as well as an actual list

disallow input variables like bnode1
make optional parts of a query and part of a translation work
